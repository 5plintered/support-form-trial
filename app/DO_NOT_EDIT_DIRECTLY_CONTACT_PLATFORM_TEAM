# All fields, in the order they should appear on the web page.
# type has a special option element 'vis_class' which indicates which vis_class will be enabled when that type is selected
# enabled_for is used to control whether a field is enabled based on the currently enabled vis_class
# options can either be a list, or a dictionary; if a dictionary, the visible option will be the 'name' value.
# a help button is automatically displayed if an item's options are a dictionary including the 'description' key.
# optional fields do not cause any red warnings.
# if supplied, prefix and suffix will wrap the result when written to the email.
