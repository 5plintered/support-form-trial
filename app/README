Running Locally:
Miniconda3-4.2.21 can be installed on your local machine somewhere (there might be an installer here /d/sw/miniconda3/latest/installer/Miniconda3-4.3.21-Linux-x86_64.sh).
Install project dependancies.
 conda env create -f environment.yml
Once installed it will need to be enabled with something like
 source ~/miniconda/bin/activate web_support
Once enabled you can then launch a server on localhost with
 python support.py
and access it at localhost:5000/test
